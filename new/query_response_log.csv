He infers that the force by which the planet moves around that focus varies inversely as the square of its distance therefrom, and demonstrates that a planet acted upon by such a force could not move in any other curve than a conic section.",8373.38,standard,True,2194,

This force causes the planets to disturb each other's orbits, especially when they are near their conjunctions.",8373.38,standard,True,2194,

However, they are restrained by a centripetal force that keeps them in their orbits. This force is directed towards the center of the orbit, which Newton calls the center of force.",8373.38,standard,True,2194,

Absolute time is also considered to be independent of any observer's frame of reference, while relative time is dependent on the observer's motion. This distinction supports Newton's laws by providing a consistent and absolute framework for the description of motion and time, which is crucial for the predictability and accuracy of his laws of motion.",8373.38,standard,True,2194,

This principle is deduced from the motion of the moon and the three laws of Kepler, which Newton demonstrated to be true.",8373.38,standard,True,2194,
